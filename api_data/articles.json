      "body": "<p>Buying any stocks right now is a brave move, given the rally in the market since this time last year. But if you're going to do so, then it's important to keep <a href=\"https://www.fool.com/investing/2017/04/10/this-chart-reveals-how-bank-stocks-are-valued.aspx\">valuation</a> and recent performance in mind.</p>\n<p>With this in mind, let's see if <strong>Goldman Sachs</strong>' <span class=\"ticker\" data-id=\"203781\">(NYSE: GS)</span> stock is worth a look.</p>\n<div class=\"image\"><img alt=\":Goldman Sachs Tower at Exchange Place in Jersey City, New Jersey.\" src=\"https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/463175/goldman-sachs-tower_large.jpg\"/>\n<p class=\"caption\">:Goldman Sachs Tower at Exchange Place in Jersey City, New Jersey. Image source: Getty Images.</p>\n</div>\n<h2><strong>Valuing Goldman's shares</strong></h2>\n<p>When it comes to valuation, you'd be excused for thinking that Goldman Sachs' stock is reasonably priced, at least compared to other bank stocks. You can see this by looking at the two valuation metrics that bank investors rely on.</p>\n<p>The first is the price-to-book value ratio, which is calculated by dividing a bank's share price by its book value per share. If a bank's share price is higher than its book value per share, then it's said to trade at a premium to book value. If the reverse is true, then it's said to trade at a discount.</p>\n<p>Goldman Sachs' price-to-book value ratio is 1.21, according to YCharts.com. That means it trades for a 21% premium to book value. That may seem high, but it's actually lower than the average big bank stock, which trades for a 33% premium to book value. On this score, then, Goldman Sachs' stock does indeed seem to be reasonably priced.</p>\n<p>The same is true if you look at another way to measure a bank stock's value -- the price-to-earnings ratio, which is calculated by dividing a bank's stock price by its earnings per share. Goldman Sachs' P/E ratio comes in at 12.64. This means that it costs $12.64 to buy every $1 of the investment bank's earnings over the next 12 months.</p>\n<p>That's a lot of money to pay for only a single dollar's worth of earnings, but it's still less than you'd have to pay to buy the typical big bank stock. Among the 20 biggest banks in the country, the average bank stock trades for 14.22 times forward earnings. On this score, too, Goldman Sachs' stock seems to be reasonably priced.</p>\n<h2><strong>Understanding Goldman's valuation</strong></h2>\n<p>Just because Goldman Sachs' shares may seem cheap doesn't mean that they necessarily are. I say that because its stock has lagged its peers this year.</p>\n<p>Since the beginning of 2017, Goldman Sachs' stock price has advanced by only 0.5%. To put that in perspective, the average big bank stock is up 7% over the same stretch. On the one hand, this seems to suggest that Goldman Sachs has more upside potential. But on the other hand, it suggests that there may be fundamental issues going on at the bank.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ycharts.com/companies/KBWB/chart/\"><img alt=\"KBWB Chart\" src=\"https://media.ycharts.com/charts/f189e9577cf493db54bb070f133188b6.png\"/></a></p>\n<p class=\"caption\"><a href=\"https://ycharts.com/companies/KBWB\">KBWB</a> data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\">YCharts</a>.</p>\n<p>There's no doubt that Goldman Sachs is one of the leaders in the financial services industry, especially among firms with operations on Wall Street. But that doesn't mean that everything always goes well for the bank.</p>\n<p>In the most recent quarter, the bank saw revenue from its bread-and-butter fixed-income trading unit <a href=\"https://www.fool.com/investing/2017/10/17/goldman-sachs-earnings-bank-combats-trading-drop-w.aspx\">decline 26%</a> compared to the year-ago quarter. The net result was that revenue in the unit was down $512 million in the three months ended Sept. 30. That alone would have amounted to a 6.3% drop in the bank's top line if other operating units hadn't made up for the shortfall elsewhere.</p>\n<p>In short, while shares of Goldman Sachs seem on their face to be reasonably priced relative to other big bank stocks, there's a reason for that. It's impossible to say if trading activity will pick up anytime soon for banks. But if it does, betting on Goldman Sachs right now could one day pay off.</p>\n<p>{%sfr%}</p>",

TheÂ Shanghai-based provider of online recruitment services came through with its fifth consecutive quarter of accelerating growth, posting another period of better-than-expected financial results after Thursday's market close. The stock finds itself within spitting distance of the all-time high it hit less than a month ago.</p>\n<p>Revenue clocked in at a record $109.5 million, up 22.4% since the prior year's showing. 51job was only targetingÂ $101 million to $104 million for its top line. A company posting year-over-year growth of 22.4% may not seem like much in light of China's glitzier dot-com darlings, but this is actually the heartiest revenue uptick at 51job since 2011.Â </p>\n<p>The pace of 51job's top-line growth continues to accelerate. It went from posting 10.2% growth during the second quarter of last year to 13.3%, 13.6%, 16%, 20.3%, and now 22.4% in subsequent periods.Â </p>\n<div class=\"image\"><img alt=\"51job headquarters with workers on the outside patio.\" src=\"https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/463186/51job_large.jpg\"/>\n<p class=\"caption\">Image source: 51job. Â </p>\n</div>\n<h2>Working for a living</h2>\n<p>There was near-perfect balance among 51job's two businesses.Â Online recruitment services -- accounting for 67% of its revenue -- rose 22.5% during the period. Other human resource-related revenue climbed at a 22.1% clip.Â </p>\n<p>Growth had been depressed since the second quarter of last year when a value-added tax or VAT policy change went into effect in May of last year. 51job lapped that headwind midway through this year's second quarter, making this the first period since the first quarter of last year when year-over-year comparisons are truly comparable.</p>\n<p>The news gets even better as we work our way down the income statement, as expanding gross margin and a 37% pop in operating income resulted in adjusted earnings of $0.50 a share. 51job's earlier outlook was calling for an adjusted profit of $0.46 to $0.49 a share, so once again we see 51job exceeding expectations on the top and bottom lines.</p>\n<p>51job's outlook for the new quarter calls for anÂ adjusted profit of $0.59 to $0.62 a share on $124 million to $127 million in revenue. We'll be looking at decelerating top-line growth even if it lands at the high end of its range -- the outlook implies 18% to 21% growth -- but it should still be 51job's 11th quarter in a row of double-digit revenue growth. If it lands near the high end, it would be the <a href=\"https://www.fool.com/investing/2017/05/05/51job-keeps-moving-to-hire-ground.aspx\">third straight period</a> of posting at least 20% top-line growth. 51job knows a thing or two about hiring, and for now, it's getting the job done.</p>\n<p>{%sfr%}</p>",

Now that the deal is out of the way, investors can focus on the day-to-day operations of the business. While the company's first-half results may not look great on paper, there are some reasons to be optimistic about its future.</p>\n<p>Here's a brief review of National Grid's most recent quarter and what management plans to do over the next couple of years.Â </p>\n<div class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Electric transmission lines at sunset.\" src=\"https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/463216/transmission-lines-3_large.jpg\"/>\n<p class=\"caption\">Image source: Getty Images.</p>\n</div>\n<h2>National Grid's results: The raw numbers</h2>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Metric*</th>\n<th>H2 2017</th>\n<th>H2 2016</th>\n<th>% Change</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Revenue</td>\n<td>$8.75 billion</td>\n<td>$8.73 billion</td>\n<td>&lt;1%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Operating profit</td>\n<td>$1.67 billion</td>\n<td>$2.05 billion</td>\n<td>(18.5%)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>After-tax profit</td>\n<td>$885 million</td>\n<td>$703 million</td>\n<td>25.9%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>EPS (ADR**)</td>\n<td>$1.24</td>\n<td>$0.92</td>\n<td>34.7%</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p class=\"caption\">Data source: National Grid earnings release. EPS = earnings per share.<br/>*NATIONAL GRID RESULTS ARE REPORTED IN BRITISH POUNDS AND WERE CONVERTED TO U.S. DOLLARS USING NATIONAL GRID'S ACCOUNTING STANDARD, WHICH IS A WEIGHTED AVERAGE EXCHANGE RATE FOR THE RESPECTIVE REPORTING PERIOD. FOR H2 2017, THE EXCHANGE RATE WAS 1 POUND = $1.31. FOR H2 2016, THE EXCHANGE RATE WAS 1 POUND = $1.39.<br/>**1 U.S. ADR = 5 COMMON SHARES OF NGG.</p>\n<p>What always seem to obscure National Grid's results are currency exchange rates. When converting to U.S. dollars, many of the company's results can change significantly. According to its earnings results -- which are given in British pounds -- revenue and earnings increased 6% and 34%, respectively.Â </p>\n<p>National Grid's sale of a 61% stake in its U.K. gas distribution business also obscured its results. As a part of that deal, the company took <a href=\"https://www.fool.com/investing/2016/11/11/national-grids-earnings-take-a-hit-from-pending-as.aspx\">589 million pounds in debt redemption costs</a> to separate the business in the second half of 2016. Those made its 2016 overall result look worse by comparison.</p>\n<p>Operating income was down across all of its segments for two reasons. One is the conversion to U.S. dollars in the respective periods. Using its reported currency, its NG Ventures and other activities segment increased modestly. The other major factor related to the timing of revenues. According to management, revenue timing negatively impacted its results by a total of 230 million pounds.</p>\n<div class=\"image\"><img alt=\"NGG adjusted operating income by business segment for H2 2016 and H2 2017. Shows declines across the board.\" src=\"https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/463216/ngg-op-profit_sSMSeHK_large.png\"/>\n<p class=\"caption\">Data source: National Grid earnings release. Chart by author.<br/>*DiscontinuedÂ operations includes National Grid's stake in its U.K. gas distribution business.</p>\n</div>\n<h2>What happened at National Grid this quarter?</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>With the sale of its U.K. gas distribution business out of the way, management's focus is now on its rate cases for its U.S. operations. With its current filings, approximatelyÂ 70% of its U.S.-based revenues will be under new rates by the end of April 2017.Â </li>\n<li>Upon completion of the U.K. gas distribution sale, management said it would repurchase 800 million pounds worth of common stock. So far, it has completed 60% of that share buyback plan and expects to finish it by the end of the fiscal year.</li>\n<li>Its fastest-growing segment is its NG Ventures segment. Management has increased capital spending in this segmentÂ by 81% to 233 million pounds for the fiscal year. Increased expenditures relate to the constructionÂ of two long-haul transmission lines connecting the U.K. with mainland Europe. Management also said it has started work on a third line from the U.K. to France and has been awarded preferred bidder status on a fourth line.</li>\n<li>The company now expects its continuing operations results for this fiscal year to be more or less in line with the prior year's results.Â </li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What management had to say</h2>\n<p>In CEO John Pettigrew's press release statement, he gave the company's outlook for 2018 and beyond:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Our outlook for the year is unchanged, underpinned by our expectations for a stronger second half. We are focused on completing rate filings in the US, continuing proactive discussions with Ofgem [U.K. office of gas and electricity markets] ahead of the next regulatory settlement in 2021 and seeking new opportunities to grow the business and optimise our performance. We are confident that our strategy continues to create value for shareholders, delivering an attractive yield, and asset growth in the 5% to 7% range.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>10-second takeaway</h2>\n<p>Even though National Grid's results don't look great in U.S. dollar terms, there are reasons to be optimistic about the company's future. Its U.K. regulated businesses are about as steady as they come and help to support its dividend and growth plan. With new rates for its U.S. business coming down the pipe in 2018, there's a good chance that it will be able to boost returns from that business by a couple of percentage points.Â </p>\n<p>The most promising segment appears to be its NG Ventures, though. The addition of long-haul transmission lines and other smaller-scale projects such as energy storage and renewable energy assets could spur growth beyond its previously sluggish pace. In the meantime, investors can expect a high-yield dividend on a consistent basis.</p>\n<p>{%sfr%}</p>",

      "body": "<h2>What happenedÂ </h2>\n<p>Failing to recover from an 11% drop in <a href=\"https://www.fool.com/investing/2017/10/10/heres-why-barrick-gold-plunged-11-in-september.aspx\">September</a>, shares of <strong>Barrick Gold</strong> <span class=\"ticker\" data-id=\"206868\">(NYSE: ABX)</span> fell 10% last month according toÂ <a href=\"http://marketintelligence.spglobal.com/\" target=\"_blank\">S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence</a>. Although there were other factors that surely affected the company's stock, it was news regarding Barrick's operations in Africa that stoked investors' fears the most.</p>\n<h2>So what</h2>\n<p>When considering the performance of a gold-mining stock, it's always worthwhile to take a step back and consider the price of gold to which gold stocks are closely correlated. TheÂ <strong>SPDR Gold Trust ETFÂ </strong><span class=\"ticker\" data-id=\"208812\">(NYSEMKT: GLD)</span>,Â for example, fell more than 1% through the month. But Barrick's precipitous decline isn't solely attributable to the dip in the yellow stuff.</p>\n<div class=\"image\"><img alt=\"A gold bar lies on a financial chart next to a pair of glasses and a calculator.\" src=\"https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/463206/gold_bar_2_large.jpg\"/>\n<p class=\"caption\">Image source: Getty Images.</p>\n</div>\n<p>Of greater concern to investors was <a href=\"https://www.fool.com/investing/2017/10/27/3-takeaways-from-barrick-golds-q3-earnings.aspx\">news pertaining toÂ Acacia Mining</a>, in which Barrick retains 64% ownership. Operating in Tanzania, Acacia Mining has been struggling since the Tanzanian government imposed a gold and copper concentrate export ban in March. Last month, Acacia's management reported that the mineral ban had adversely affected production approximately 35%; moreover, the company revealed that it had a buildup of approximately $265 million of concentrate inventory.</p>\n<p>Barrick, last month, announced that it had taken a significant step toward resolving the dispute with the Tanzania government. Splitting equally the \"economic benefits\" of Acacia's future operations with the government of Tanzania, Barrick reported that Acacia will grant a 16% interest in each of its three mines to the Tanzanian government. In addition, Acacia willÂ provide a $300 million payment to settle tax disputes. Barrick foresees finalizing the proposed agreement, which is subject to Acacia's review and approval, in the first half of 2018.</p>\n<p>During its third-quarter earnings report, Barrick reported that it provided a $172 million payment of the $300 million tax provision to the Tanzanian government. According to management, the tax provision and the concentrate export ban were two factors that contributed to the company's net loss of $11 million in the third quarter.</p>\n<h2>Now what</h2>\n<p>Although the proposed agreement with the Tanzanian government indicates progress toward ending the discord, unresolved issues remain. For one, it's unclear whether Barrick will have to make additional payments. In Barrick's press release, management noted that the $300 million payment was \"a gesture of good faith.\" Over the summer, though, the Tanzanian government had presented Acacia with a bill of $190 billion in fines and allegedly unpaid taxes from two of its mines, according to <a href=\"http://www.mining.com/acacia-mining-now-hit-190-billion-tax-bill-tanzania/\">mining.com</a>. Furthermore, it's unclear when the export ban will be lifted.</p>\n<p>Investors dislike many things, but one of their greatest fears is uncertainty. And the uncertainty of how much -- if not all -- of a $190 billion tax bill Barrick will be faced with is clearly enough to remove some luster from the stock. Moving forward, investors should certainly exercise caution and keep a sharp eye on how the narrative with the Tanzanian government unfolds.Â </p>\n<p>{%sfr%}</p>",

Google still utilizes NVIDIA's GPUs for its cloud services, and it's clear from all of this competition that AI will remain a focal point for these tech giants. The AI investments these companies are making for their cloud services are helping expand the cloud computing market from $260 billion this year to $440 billion by 2020 according to <strong>Gartner</strong> <a href=\"https://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/3815165\">research</a>.Â </p>\n<p>That's good news for NVIDIA because it means that sales of GPUs are likely to grow as AI cloud computing services become more common.<strong><br/></strong></p>\n<h2>NVIDIA's big AI picture</h2>\n<p>I've touched on two key AI opportunities for NVIDIA so far, but the company believes it has several others, including nascent markets like AI cities, that give it a total addressable market in AI of $40 billion.</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Technology</strong></td>\n<td><strong>NVIDIA total addressable marketÂ </strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>AI for high-performance computing (HPC)</td>\n<td>$4 billion by 2020</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Deep Learning training</td>\n<td>$11 billion by 2020</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Deep Learning inference</td>\n<td>$15 billionÂ by 2020</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Autonomous cars</td>\n<td>$8 billion by 2025</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>AI for cities</td>\n<td>$2 billion by 2021</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p class=\"caption\">Data source: <a href=\"http://files.shareholder.com/downloads/AMDA-1XAJD4/4376258341x0x942329/A2FCD200-F141-4A26-8E5D-215F6F2171E0/NVIDIA_Investor_Day_2017.pdfÂ \">NVIDIA.</a></p>\n<p>Investors should know that NVIDIA doesn't break out its AI revenue specifically, mainly because it's the AI GPUs, which are sold across several of the company's business segments. As AI grows this could change, but it's safe to say that at this point AI is still a relatively small aspect of the company's top and bottom lines. Â </p>\n<p>But NVIDIA's competition in the GPU space is limited, which makes it an intriguing prospect for artificial intelligence investors. <strong>Intel</strong> is making its way in the AI space as well, and Google could transition to its own TPUs in the future, but more and more companies are transitioning to GPUs for their AI needs, and they're choosing NVIDIA right now.</p>\n<p>As NVIDIA continues to innovate, with new hardware like Pegasus, it's clear that the company should be able to maintain its lead in the artificial intelligence hardware market and bring big gains to investors at the same time.</p>\n<p>{%sfr%}</p>",

In Intel's latest 10-Q filing, Intel said that year-to-date operating income in DCG was negatively affected to the tune of $555 million compared with last year, thanks to what Intel says are \"higher factory start-up costs\" that are \"primarily driven by the ramp of ... 10nm process technology.\"</p>\n<p>This means Intel's DCG business unit is now shouldering virtually the entirety of the costs associated with bringing the company's first 10nm factories online -- just as the company told investors it would back in February.</p>\n<p>Now, the good news is that while DCG bears this burden, Intel's client-computing group, which supplies processors into the PC market, is relieved of it.Â </p>\n<h2><strong>14nm yield improvements significantly boosted profits</strong></h2>\n<p>While on the topic of chip-manufacturing technology, Intel's 10-Q had some great news about Intel's 14nm technology, whichÂ first went into production in the middle of 2014. By the end of 2015, a large portion of Intel's client processor shipments had migrated to 14nm from the older, more mature 22nm. Today, the vast majority of Intel's processors are built using some derivative of its 14nm technology.Â </p>\n<p>Since 14nm yield rates -- that is, the percentage of chips produced that prove salable -- <a href=\"https://www.fool.com/investing/general/2015/12/14/intel-corps-desktop-skylake-shortage-is-disappoint.aspx\">weren't particularly great in 2015</a>, Intel's gross profit margin suffered from the 22nm-to-14nm transition. InÂ 2016, 14nm yield rates improved, which led to margin improvements for the company. So far this year, Intel seems to have enjoyed even more yield rate improvements. The company says that year over year, it enjoyed a $930 million boost to gross profit thanks to \"lower platform unit cost, primarily on 14nm cost improvement.\"</p>\n<p>What this means is simple: Yield rates got better, which lowered the effective per-chip manufacturing costs for products built using its 14nm technology. That cost-structure improvement meant that Intel was selling chips for roughly the same prices, but they are cheaper to make, meaning that its profitability per chip increased.</p>\n<h2><strong>Notebook chip increases offset desktop chip declines</strong></h2>\n<p>Intel says that year to date, it has seen its desktop processor shipments decline 4% from a year ago, which led to $482 million lower revenue from the same period a year ago. However, that decline was more than offset by several factors.</p>\n<div class=\"image\"><img alt=\"An Intel desktop processor.\" src=\"https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/462838/8th-gen-intel-core-s-series-chip_large.jpg\"/>\n<p class=\"caption\">Image source: Intel.</p>\n</div>\n<p>First, Intel says an increase in notebook processor unit sales of 5% led to a revenue boost of $657 million from a year ago. That increase alone more than offset the decline in desktop chip shipments. But it gets better from here.</p>\n<p>Intel also says it saw a $571 million increase in sales, thanks to a 4% increase in the average selling prices of its notebook chips. That increase, Intel says, was due to shipping a richer mix of processors. In other words, customers, on average, bought more expensive chips.</p>\n<p>Put simply: A surge in Intel's notebook processor shipments and average selling prices year to date more than compensated for the unit shipment declines that Intel saw in its desktop processor business.</p>\n<p>{%sfr%}</p>",

The movement was primarily driven by the company's better-than-expected first-quarter results.Â </p>\n<div class=\"image\"><img alt=\"An illustration of two people working on three stacks of data.\" src=\"https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/462986/atlassian_large.png\"/>\n<p class=\"caption\">Image source: Altassian.</p>\n</div>\n<h2>So what</h2>\n<p>Atlassian reported <a href=\"https://www.fool.com/investing/2017/10/20/new-products-and-new-customers-drive-atlassians-st.aspx\">earnings</a> on Oct. 19 and gave shareholders plenty to be happy about. The average analyst estimate had called for the enterprise software company to record adjusted profits of $0.09 per share, but actual adjusted profits came in at $0.12 per share -- a 20% improvement over the prior-year period. Sales also came in ahead of the market's expectations, increasing 42% year over year to reach roughly $194 million.Â </p>\n<h2>Now what</h2>\n<p>In conjunction with its recent quarterly report, Atlassian management issued a strong outlook for the business. The company expects to record adjusted full-year profits between $0.46 and $0.47 on sales that will come in between $841 and $847 million. Management also indicated that it saw its collaboration software performing well even as competitors including <strong>Cisco</strong>, <strong>Microsoft</strong>, and <strong>Facebook</strong> put increasing focus on the space.Â Shares continued to gain ground following the earnings release and now trade up around 117% on the year.</p>\n<p>The stock now sports lofty multiples, with its forward price-to-earnings ratio sitting at roughly 110 and its forward price-to-sales ratio at about 14, but Atlassian looks to have growth ahead as it continues to build its customer base and increase prices for its cloud software and service products.</p>\n<p>{%sfr%}</p>",

However, the company lowered its outlook to earnings per share of between $3.10 and $3.20, and its full-year sales target to between $6.48 billion and $6.53 billion due to weakness in the ATM market. The segment's sales fell 17% year over year in the third quarter.</p>\n<h2>Now what</h2>\n<p>NCR expects that its ATM business will wind up down roughly 20% year over year at the close of 2017, but management also believes the segment will rebound next fiscal year. The company is focused on building its recurring revenue streams by expanding its cloud-based offerings, but hardware remains at the center of NCR's business, so its medium-term performance will likely be closely tied to whether sales for its ATM and self-checkout devices and their related software components improve.Â </p>\n<p>{%sfr%}</p>",
